His career has been defined by his ability to blend technical expertise in the construction industry with a sharp sales acumen, allowing him to manage complex projects while also driving client satisfaction and business growth. Davidâ€™s career trajectory showcases his adaptability and dedication to delivering high-quality work across residential and commercial sectors.Davidâ€™s career in construction began in 2006, shortly after he graduated high school. He started as a laborer with a local construction company based in Chicago, Illinois. His early years were spent learning the fundamentals of construction work, including site preparation, material handling, and assisting skilled tradespeople. David quickly gained a reputation for his strong work ethic and ability to tackle physically demanding tasks in a fast-paced environment. By 2008, David was promoted to apprentice carpenter. This role marked the beginning of his deeper involvement in the technical side of construction. He became proficient in framing, drywall installation, and the finishing work required for both residential and commercial buildings.
